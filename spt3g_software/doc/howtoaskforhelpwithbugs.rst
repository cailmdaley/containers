How to Ask for Debugging Help
-----------------------------
There are without a doubt bugs in our analysis code that are waiting for you to stumble over.  Sorry.  There are people willing to help fix things, that want to help fix things.  Help them, help you.

It is important to provide enough information to the person you are asking to help you.  Please provide the following information:

1. As detailed description of the bug as possible.
2. A script that reproduces the bug/crash/error.
3. The exact command used to run the script.  If it requires command line arguments, please provide them.

That's it.  Just make it so the people helping you can help as quickly and as easily as possible.
