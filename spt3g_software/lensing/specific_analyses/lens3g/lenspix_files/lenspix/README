This is where lenspix should be clone to.

The SimLens.f90 provided here is a modified version of the original SimLens.f90.
The difference is that you feed in a specific phi map, whereas the original code generates a realization on the fly. It requires a full TQU and phi maps as inputs. If you are only interested in the T map, you will still need to set the Q/U parts to zero.

Additionally there are flags to remove E/B modes:
set_B_zero = F
set_E_zero = F
but these options are more for delensing purposes (and not for standard lensing analyses).
