Whatever liz used


Cluster masking:  
bispectrum/bisp_0809_fields/calc_bisp_0809_fields.pro

cut on mass rather than signal to noise

masses come from full cluster cosmology pipeline, has not been run in a final state for full 2500 sq degrees

Get a list of cluster masses from Tijmen.  Need to convert from mass Tijmen is estimating to mass we are comparing to in suman sims and model.
there is a comment in the code how to convert.


2D Transfer Function Generation:

In Painting:

xy locations and mask radii hand map to in painter
call_run_interp_quick



cross check diffusive in painter


Noise PSD generation:  weighted psds vs unweighted, we want unweighted




Todo:
-email tijmen to ge the cluster list
-read through 0809 script to get everything
