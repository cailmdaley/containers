badObs.csv contains a list of "permafailed" observation IDs, along with the person who marked that 
observation bad and a "note" column where users can put a few words about why the observation was marked bad.  

Only observations that are so bad they should never be included in science results should be added to this list

If this list is populated automatically in the future, the 'added by' field can be marked as 'AUTO'

The 'note' field can be left blank
