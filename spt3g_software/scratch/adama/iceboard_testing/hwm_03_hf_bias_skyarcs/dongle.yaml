# dongle.yaml
#
# This hardware map is for a dongle with resistive and LC channels. The channel
# frequencies are set approximately uniformly between 1MHz and 7MHz, each with
# a uniform random shift equal to 25% of the uniform frequency spacing. This is
# to avoid channel interference at integer multiples of bias frequencies.
