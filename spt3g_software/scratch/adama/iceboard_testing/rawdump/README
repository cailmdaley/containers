Checklist:
1. Control computer with at least 2 gigabit interfaces
2. Gigabit ethernet switch, minimum four ports
3. Cables to connect same
4. Lots of hard drive space (> 1 TB)

Hardware setup:
1. Attach all three ethernet ports on Iceboard to switch -- it doesn't matter which ports
2. Attach one gigabit port on computer to switch
3. Attach other gigabit port to internet

Software setup:
1. Setup DHCP server on control computer for the IceBoard. Any private IP range will do *except* for 192.168.154.0/24.
2. Add a second IP address on control computer's interface connected to Iceboard of 192.168.154.200/24.
3. On control computer, echo 5000000000000 > /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max
4. Make sure any security features along the lines of "broadcast storm control" are disabled on the ethernet switch.
5. Make sure control computer's time is synchronized to 1 ms or better from GPS. This is the only source of astronomical timing you have, so it had better be right.

Compiling and running code:
1. cc -O3 -o rdrecord rdrecord.c
2. python rdinit.py 1	(last argument is the SQUID number to dump)
3. ./rdrecord outfile

The timestamp printed to the console should be noted and can be passed to core.G3Time(whateverwasprinted) to get the time of the first sample, accurate to at least a ms.
