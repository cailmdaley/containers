You can run the script as:
python make_3g_sims.py --paramfile params_for_sims.txt --op-folder test --noofsims 2 --make-cmb-skies 1 --make-foreground-skies 1

Reading CAMB:

reads CAMB params file and Cls file from spt3g_software/simulations/camb

Note: you must have the env. variable set $spt3g_software_PATH. For this do, export spt3g_software_PATH=/path/to/spt3g_software
otherwise it jsut reads it from /home/sri/spt3g_software/simulations/camb

The Cls file is picked from the CAMB params file using the outputroot string and the input cosmology. 

Based on CMB_outputscale in the params file, Tcmb factor will be mulplied to Cls.

CMB sky:
creates them using simple healpix routines. 

####################
foreground sky:
creates Gaussian realisations of radio, tSZ, kSZ, CIB+clus (<6.4 mJy) using George 2015 results
Poisson realisation of CIB above 6.4mJy is also performed (flux limits can be specified in paramsfile while running)
Pol. sims are also created (pol.fracs in params file; for Poisson sims - we assume random pol. angle of sources)
