std_processing
--------------

The std_processing directory is designed to include code that implements standard approaches that we take to the data as part of analysis rather than algorithms. As an example, this could be something like "do the standard SPT3G first-pass timestream filtering", as distinct from "apply a polynomial filter to the timestreams". As such, most of the things in this directory are meant to be pipe segments that define standard configurations and combinations of processing modules found elsewhere in the tree.
